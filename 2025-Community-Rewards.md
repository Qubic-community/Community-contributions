# CCF Proposal  
## Qubic Community Rewards – 2025  

### 1. Summary  
To acknowledge outstanding volunteer contributions and encourage continued grassroots momentum, we propose a onetime 21.5 b QUBIC Community Rewards allocation across three tracks: Community, Marketing, and Tech. Nominees were crowdsourced, screened for recent impact, and grouped by contribution type. This streamlined slate avoids dozens of separate polls, expediting recognition while keeping the CCF treasury process lightweight.

### 3. Rationale & Selection Criteria  
1. **Recency of Impact** – Only contributors active in the last six months were eligible.  
2. **Cross Category Flexibility** – Paid part-timers in one track could still be nominated for distinct work in another.  
3. **Substantiated Nominations** – Each entry required a stated reason and suggested amount; blank or vague submissions were discarded.  
4. **Pragmatic Governance** – A single up or down vote minimizes voter fatigue and lets the community iterate quickly on future rounds.

Should this slate be approved, the jury will collect wallet addresses and initiate transfers within three business days. A follow-up proposal can be drafted later to capture new faces or additional achievements.

### 4. Governance Motion  
**Proposal:** Approve the Community Rewards slate above and authorize a one-time disbursement of 21.5 b QUBIC from the CCF treasury to the listed recipients.

**Voting Options:**  
- **YES** – Distribute rewards as proposed.  
- **NO** – Reject and request revisions or a fresh nomination cycle.

**Voting Period:** 5 days (suggested).

### 5. Conclusion  
Qubic thrives on volunteer energy—developers building dashboards, evangelists running AMAs, and helpers guiding newcomers. Ratifying this proposal delivers timely appreciation to those contributors while maintaining a transparent, criteria-driven process. A YES vote signals that community initiative is both seen and valued, laying the groundwork for even greater participation in Qubic’s next growth phase.
